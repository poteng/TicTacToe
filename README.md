# AI played Tic Tac Toe game
This program uses Alpha-Beta-Pruning and MinMax-A-B algorithms to implement a tic-tac-toe game platform.

The user can choose from three different evaluation functions to be computer's "strategy". 

The computers will use those strategies to play against each other.


## Strategies
Currently, the program supports three different strategies.

#### Textbook's
Evaluation function form textbook

#### Po-Teng's
Evaluation function created by Po-Teng

#### Tommy's
Evaluation function created by Tommy

## Depth of algorithm
Currently, the supported depths are 2 and 4 only.


## Installation

Build and run the [cpp file](main.cpp).

When the program starts:

- Input the max depth when it asks. (can only be 2 or 4)

- Choose evaluation functions for player1 and player2.

Player 1 will be the first player and use X mark.

The rest of process is automatic.
